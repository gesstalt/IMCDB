AS ARJUNA LOOKED UP, THE LIGHT DAZZLED HIM. HE SAW IN IT ALL BEINGS. IT SEEMED TO HIM AS HE WERE LOOKING AT CREATION; THE WHOLE OF CREATION; EVERY-THING IN CREATION; LOOKING AT THE WHOLE OF THE PAST; THE WHOLE OF THE PRESENT AND THE WHOLE OF THE FUTURE - ALL AT ONCE. IT WAS A SIGHT NO MAN HAD SEEN BEFORE. IT STAGGERED AND STUPEFIED HIM. HE WAS AS IF THE OBSERVER OF THE WHOLE DRAMA OF LIFE.
